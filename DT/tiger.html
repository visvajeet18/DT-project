        <p>The tiger (*Panthera tigris*) is the largest cat species, easily recognized by its orange coat with black stripes. Tigers are apex predators, primarily found in Asia, inhabiting forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps.</p>
        <p>Each tigerâ€™s stripe pattern is unique, helping them camouflage in their natural habitat. They are solitary hunters, stalking prey and ambushing it with a powerful pounce.</p>
        <p>Poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict are significant threats to tigers, leading to a drastic decline in their population over the last century.</p>
        <p>Conservation efforts focus on creating protected reserves, enforcing anti-poaching laws, and restoring natural habitats. Community-based conservation programs also help reduce human-tiger conflicts.</p>
        <p>Tigers are symbols of biodiversity and play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems by controlling herbivore populations.</p>
	<p>Tigers are listed as Endangered, with only around 3,900 individuals left in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching.
They once roamed across much of Asia, but today their range is limited to only about 6% of their historical territory.
Poaching for their fur, bones, and other body parts continues to be a significant threat despite international bans.
Habitat loss due to deforestation, particularly for agriculture and development, is shrinking their living space.
Human-wildlife conflict arises when tigers stray into human settlements in search of prey, leading to retaliatory killings.
Tigers are solitary animals, so conserving their territories and reducing human encroachment is critical to their survival.
Conservation organizations are working to establish more protected areas and create wildlife corridors that connect fragmented habitats.
The illegal wildlife trade remains one of the biggest challenges to tiger conservation, with tiger parts often sold on the black market.
The tiger's role as an apex predator is vital for maintaining the balance of their ecosystems by controlling herbivore populations.
Collaborative efforts across international borders are necessary, as tigers often roam across multiple countries, requiring coordinated protection strategies.</p>
