        <p>The Fiji banded iguana (*Brachylophus fasciatus*) is a rare and vibrant green lizard with distinct white or blue bands. It is native to the islands of Fiji, where it lives in rainforests, often near streams.</p>
        <p>This iguana is primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers, although it may also eat insects. Its diet plays an important role in seed dispersal for various plant species.</p>
        <p>Habitat loss, invasive species, and illegal pet trade are significant threats to the Fiji banded iguana. Feral cats and rats introduced to Fiji have also impacted their population.</p>
        <p>Conservation efforts include habitat protection, captive breeding, and reintroduction programs. Local education initiatives aim to reduce the capture of these iguanas for the pet trade.</p>
        <p>The Fiji banded iguana is a unique reptile, contributing to Fiji’s biodiversity and serving as a flagship species for conservation efforts in the region.</p>
	<p>The Fiji banded iguana is classified as Endangered, with only a few hundred individuals left in the wild.
Habitat destruction, particularly from deforestation for agriculture and development, has severely reduced their range.
Invasive species like rats, cats, and pigs pose a significant threat by preying on eggs and young iguanas.
The illegal pet trade has also contributed to their declining numbers, as they are sought after for exotic collections.
They are highly specialized in their diet, depending on native plant species, many of which are also under threat.
Predation by introduced species on eggs and hatchlings is a major factor in their low survival rates.
Conservation efforts include habitat restoration and the establishment of protected areas on Fiji’s islands.
Captive breeding programs have been established to maintain a stable population in zoos and reserves.
Local communities are being engaged to control the invasive species and protect native habitats.
Their survival is critical for maintaining the ecological integrity of Fiji’s unique rainforest ecosystems.</p>
